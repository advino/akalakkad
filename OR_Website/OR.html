      <h4>What will life be like in a future affected by climate change?</h4>
      <p id="blurb">
        Ever so slowly our world becomes less inhabitable. Time constructs allow us to understand the global effects of climate change, but leave us unable to fathom the personal effects climate change will have on our daily lives.
        </br>
        </br>
        Enter the Overlayed Reality, a window into the future of our planet's climate. We can now experienece the effects of climate change in a personal and dynamic manner.
        </br>
        </br>
        Through the use of a specially designed AR headset, sensory feedback, both visual and haptic immerses the user in a future ravaged by urban heating. Through navigating this new reality, we come to understand the role climate change plays in shaping our
        daily routines, while learning to mitigate this future through embedded strategies.
